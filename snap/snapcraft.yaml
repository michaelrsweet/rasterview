description: |
  RasterView is an Apple, CUPS, and PWG raster file viewer.  It basically allows
  you to look at the raster data produced by any of the standard CUPS RIP filters
  (cgpdftoraster, imagetoraster, pdftoraster, and pstoraster) and is normally used
  to either test those filters or look at the data that is being sent to your
  raster printer driver.  RasterView is provided as free software under the
